  Manages Google Cloud Workload Manager evaluations, executions, rules, scanned
  resources, and validation results by using the public client libraries and
  REST API. Use when you need to inspect workload best-practice rules, create
  and run evaluations for Google Cloud general best practices, SAP, SQL Server,
  or custom organizational rules, review violations, export results to
  BigQuery, or automate Workload Manager through the SDK because no
  service-specific public CLI or MCP server is available.

# Workload Manager Basics

Workload Manager validates enterprise workloads against Google Cloud best
practices and recommendations. The public SDK surface is centered on
evaluations: define a resource scope, choose built-in or custom rules, run an
execution, then inspect results and scanned resources.

## Use This Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Rules["List rules"] --> Eval["Create or update evaluation"]
    Resources["Project, folder, or org scope"] --> Eval
    Eval --> Run["Run evaluation"]
    Run --> Results["Inspect execution results"]
    Results --> Remediate["Remediate findings"]
    Results --> Export["Optional BigQuery export"]
```

## Prerequisites

1. Enable the Workload Manager API:

   ```bash
   gcloud services enable workloadmanager.googleapis.com --quiet
   ```

2. Authenticate locally before using client libraries or REST:

   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   gcloud auth login
   ```

3. Grant the narrowest role needed for the task. Start with
   `roles/workloadmanager.viewer` for read-only inspection and use
   `roles/workloadmanager.evaluationAdmin` or
   `roles/workloadmanager.admin` only when creating, updating, running, or
   deleting evaluations.

## Quick SDK Example

Use the Python client library for the first working automation path:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade google-cloud-workloadmanager
```

```python
from google.cloud import workloadmanager_v1

project_id = "PROJECT_ID"
location = "LOCATION"
parent = f"projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}"

client = workloadmanager_v1.WorkloadManagerClient()

rules = client.list_rules(
    request=workloadmanager_v1.ListRulesRequest(
        parent=parent,
        evaluation_type=workloadmanager_v1.Evaluation.EvaluationType.OTHER,
    )
)

for rule in rules.rules:
    print(rule.name, rule.display_name, rule.severity)
```

  executions, results, scanned resources, supported workload types, and API
  shape.

- [General Best Practices](references/general-best-practices.md): Google Cloud
  general best-practice posture checks, `OTHER` evaluation guidance, custom
  Rego rules, and scale/automation patterns.

- [Client Libraries](references/client-library-usage.md): Python and Go SDK
  examples for listing rules, creating evaluations, running evaluations, and
  reading findings.

- [REST Usage](references/rest-usage.md): Direct REST examples for the public
  Workload Manager API and operations polling.

- [Public CLI Status](references/public-cli-status.md): No documented
  service-specific `gcloud workload-manager` command group; use `gcloud` only
  for auth, IAM, API enablement, and REST tokens.

- [Public MCP Status](references/public-mcp-status.md): No documented public
  Workload Manager MCP server; use SDK or REST instead.

- [Setup Prerequisites](references/setup-prerequisites.md): Terraform examples
  only for adjacent prerequisites such as API enablement, IAM, BigQuery export
  datasets, and KMS keys. This is not Workload Manager resource management.

- [IAM & Security](references/iam-security.md): Workload Manager roles,
  least-privilege guidance, service agents, data handling, and CMEK notes.

If product behavior or API fields are not covered here, check the current
Workload Manager product documentation and client library reference before
implementing.
